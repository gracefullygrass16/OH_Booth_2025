Interactive Web Design Activity: Set up laptops where visitors can customise elements of a simple website (e.g., change colours, fonts, and layout), and see the results of that change in real-time. This gives them hands-on experience with CSS and HTML basics.

"Fix the Code" Puzzle: Present a small web page with intentional errors in the HTML or CSS, challenging visitors to identify and fix the code. Offer small rewards such as candy for those who manage to troubleshoot the issues successfully.

Tasks (also in readme): 
1. change 'this is the infocomm & robotics society' to their own name
2. change the button colour
3. change the date in the calendar thing to the correct date
4. change the font size/color/type to something like blue and bold and 50px
